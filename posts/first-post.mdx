Insert clickbait here

After having wrangled with different technologies over the past couple of years, like many developers before me, I've decided its time to try and compose my thoughts and the things I've learnt into some kind of consumable format.
Therefore I present to you, the <em>blog-of-andy</em>.
Built from the ground up using Next.js, this bad boy will be serving sleek, sexy and statically generated pages containing at least one blog post of <em>useless information</em> (this one). Where we go from there though is yet to be seen.

### Possible future topics include

- Procedural audio plugin for unity?
- Godot tutorials?
- Some kind of paediatric growth charts app?

In all honesty, I don't have a whole lot to say but really wanted to try out Next.js and also wanted to try to gain some experience in deploying a site.
For this one I've decided to use AWS Amplify, mainly because I found a youtube tutorial that showed how to do it in about three minutes and have to say it looks impressive!
